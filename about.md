This is the personal blog for Dave Smith a 4th Year Phd Student at the Uniesriy of Oxford.
I work on the Hepatitis C Virus and anit-viral resistance using next generation seqeuncing,
bioinfomatics and in-vitro models to understand the effect of Resistance Associated Substitutions.

I also have an interest in health, fitness and wellbeing and using data to try optimise these.
